Description:
This project aims to gather, analyze, and visualize news articles related to hydrogen developments from reputable sources such as CNBC and Google News. Using web scraping techniques, it extracts headlines, dates, and sources from CNBC's search results for "green hydrogen." Additionally, it utilizes the Google News RSS feed to collect headlines and dates for the same keyword.

The project incorporates sentiment analysis to evaluate the sentiment expressed in each news article regarding hydrogen-related topics. Leveraging a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face, it provides insights into the public sentiment surrounding hydrogen.

Furthermore, the project employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to identify and extract organization names mentioned in the news headlines. This allows for a detailed examination of key industry players and stakeholders involved in hydrogen-related developments.

The findings are presented through insightful visualizations, including sentiment trends over time and a word cloud highlighting the prominence of various organizations within the hydrogen sector. These visual representations aid in decision-making and strategic planning for stakeholders interested in hydrogen technologies and investments.

This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization techniques, providing valuable insights into the evolving landscape of hydrogen technologies.
